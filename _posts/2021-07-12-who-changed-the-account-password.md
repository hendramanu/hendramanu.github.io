Account, an _internet identity_ of someone. As we know, it should be private. From the day we created it until the day we delete it (if possible tho). But what happens if it's being controlled by someone?

# What happened?
This is my personal story about _account_. Not too interesting, but I hope it will be useful for me and you.

The story begins from the day my parents bought a new phone for their shop (the phone brand doesn't matter here), because the old one was very slow and old. There are some problems regarding moving old account and contacts to the new phone.

Because my family stay in Tulungagung, while the shop is at Bali, my parents decided to ask the shop keeper to configure it. And it's fine. The phone is set up normally and currently in use.

Some days later, one day before my nephew's birthday, my mother wants to play 'Happy Birthday' video for her granddaughter. But, when opening YouTube, there was a pop up that said about her account was signed out for a reason and she should re-login to continue. Of course she wants to re-login, but she forgot the password.

> This is Google account

Then she asks me to help her. I know the password (since it was me that created the password) and then I entered it. Suddenly, "Your Password Has Been Changed Some Days Ago" text appeared.

> _What The...?_

I immediately reset the password, so I click "Forgot Password" and answered a/two question(s). Fortunately Google detected that I'm the real owner and I'm being redirected to "New Password" form.

I'm sure you know the next.

# Ooh ok.... So?

Not judging someone, but I'm pretty sure the person who changed the password was the shop keepeer.

_Why?_

1. Not me nor family who changed the password.
2. My parents shop keeper isn't understand much about phone.

# Conclusion

We know that phone shop keeper doesn't has bad mind to change my mother's account password. But we should keep the account a secret. Never trust anyone to handle your account. Not only account, even your email too. Better not to share it to public.

And if your account already done like above, immediately recovery it, e.g. changing password, checking session, etc.

Thanks for reading.
